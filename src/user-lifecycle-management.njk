summary: Keep user accounts in sync across systems
description: Synchronize new and updated user account information between your app and a central user directory. Your app gets the changes when a user's profile is updated in the central user directory and vice versa.
          Automate the entire lifecycle of user onboarding, updates, and offboarding. Reduce the complexity your app adds to your enterprise customers' ecosystems.
