Session termination allows administrators of your customer's central user store to sign users out of apps managed by the central user store. Your app gets an event to end the user's authenticated session.

Has a user left their job? The central user store administrator can send the event to sign the user out of all their work apps, including yours. Has an alert come in from the Shared Signals Framework about a user? Sign them out of all their apps, and then suspend their accounts.
