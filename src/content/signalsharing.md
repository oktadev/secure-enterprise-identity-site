The Shared Signals Framework provides a virtual security alert board for apps and enterprises to raise the alarm to other apps and react to alert notifications. Is a bad actor trying to brute-force their way into an account? Alert others so they can suspend that account temporarily until the threat is resolved. Is a user trying to spend past their credit limit? Alert others that the user may do the same in their apps as well. See the whole picture of a user's behavior and act accordingly.
