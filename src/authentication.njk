summary: Sign in once and access all your apps
description: Sign in once and be signed in anywhere. Apps that support Single Sign-On check if a user is already signed into another app before asking them to sign on in full. This improves your users' sign-in experience and significantly reduces the admin cost of managing user accounts and permissions.
